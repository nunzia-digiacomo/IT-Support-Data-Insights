# IT HelpDesk Performance Analysis & Optimization
Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven evaluation of an IT HelpDesk ecosystem. By analysing 9,357 unique support requests, the study identifies critical operational bottlenecks, ticket distribution patterns, and software/hardware reliability trends to improve service level agreements (SLAs) and resource allocation.

# Key Objectives

Operational Intelligence: Track monthly ticket volume trends to forecast peak demand periods.

Issue Categorization: Identify the most frequent technical hurdles, such as Troubleshoot Software and Troubleshoot Hardware.

Workflow Efficiency: Analyze resolution times and identify common bottlenecks in the IT support lifecycle.

# Technical Stack

Data Processing: Python (Pandas, NumPy) for cleaning and feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Systematic data profiling and distribution analysis.

Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for time-series forecasting and categorical heatmaps.

# Core Insights

Volume Metrics: Successfully processed and cleaned a dataset of 9,357 records across 32 distinct features.

Trend Analysis: Evaluated monthly ticket creation spikes to assist in proactive staffing during high-demand windows.

Resolution Profiling: Mapped the relationship between "Request Type" and "Resolution Status" to determine which technical areas require specialized agent training.
